## Assumptions:

The user would only input capital letters.

The user would not input values outside of scope for jumps (we implemented, but did not test)
        
## What works:
All instructions, but did not test thoroughly on them.

## Errors:
Did not check on all instructions thoroughly.

We assumed 2 stations for RET and CALL

CALL does not work properly.

No Flushing.
